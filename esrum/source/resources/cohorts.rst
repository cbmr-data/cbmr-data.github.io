 Human cohorts

The Data Analytics Platform maintains a `list of cohorts`_ and an
associated `catalog of cohort variables`_, in order to help you identify
relevant cohorts for your research. In many, but not all cases, DAP also
facilitates access to this data on Esrum.

The `list of cohorts`_ and the `catalog of cohort variables`_ provide
brief descriptions of the cohorts and of the variables associated with
these, respectively, but you are welcome to :ref:`contact us
<p_contact>` if you have any questions regarding these.

.. warning::

   You must be connected to the UCPH VPN to access either of these
   pages!

*********************
 Applying for access
*********************

In order to get access to a cohort managed by DAP, the data owner must
first grant approval. This step varies between cohorts, as data owners
have different methods of governing access, but often involves a simple
email exchange. Other requests may require review by a committee or
another type of review.

To initiate this process, fill out the `data access form`_ and send it
to `SUND-CBMR-Esrum <mailto:cbmr-esrum@sund.ku.dk>`_. Note that you
*must* use a UCPH e-mail account when writing to us on this address:
Mail from external addresses is currently blocked.

Access will be granted once permission to access the cohort has been
formally granted and DAP has been informed. You will receive an
automated email that ``Changes to your Identity were processed``, after
which it may take up to 24 hours before you can access the project
folder(s) on Esrum.
