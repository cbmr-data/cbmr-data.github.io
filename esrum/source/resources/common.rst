 Common datasets

The Data Analytics platform maintains a set of commonly used resources
in ``/datasets/cbmr_shared``.

This folder contains a range of public datasets, including

-  ``genomes/`` for commonly used reference genomes, such as various
   human reference genomes.

-  ``databases/`` for databases such as dbSNP_, ClinVar_, and more.

-  ``resources/`` for heterogeneous resources and resources used by
   specific tools, such as the `GATK resource bundle`, VEP_ annotation
   caches, and more.

-  ``indices`` for index files generated from genomes or other files,
   such as the index files generated by BWA_ or Bowtie2_.

README files are included in each (sub)folder with additional
information about the sources, versions, and command-line options used
to generate the dataset, as appropriate.

********************************
 Requesting additional datasets
********************************

New datasets and new releases of datasets are added by request. To
request that a dataset, including new releases of an existing dataset,
be added simply `contact us <p_contact>`_ with the location (URL) of the
dataset and the specific release you are interested in. For datasets
with multiple versions, e.g. for different genomic builds, please
specify the version you are interested in.

Note that the data must have been released under a license that allows
it to be accessed by all employees of CBMR, their collaborators,
students, and anyone else who might get access to Esrum. Data under
restrictive licenses should instead be added to a private project or
dataset folder, such that only those with a valid license
