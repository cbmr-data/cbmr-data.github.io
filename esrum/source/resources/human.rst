 Human Cohorts
###############

The Data Analytics Platform provides an overview of human cohort data
used at CBMR and, in many cases, facilitates access to this data. A
short description of the datasets governed by the platform together with
the relevant names of Esrum folders is located at TODO.

A catalogue of `cohorts and their associated variables`_ is furthermore
provided in order to help you identify relevant cohorts for your
research. Not all cohorts and available variables are currently covered,
but content is continually being expanded.

..
   Why doesn't the catalogue contain the description of the cohorts?

.. warning::

   You must be connected to the UCPH VPN to use the cohort catalogue!

*********************
 Applying for access
*********************

In order to get access to a cohort managed by DAP, the data owner must
first grant approval. This step varies between cohorts, as data owners
have different methods of governing access, but often involves a simple
email exchange. Other requests may require review by a committee or
another type of review.

To initiate this process, fill out the form under TODO and send it to
`SUND-CBMR-Esrum <mailto:cbmr-esrum@sund.ku.dk>`_. Note that that you
*must* use a UCPH e-mail account when writing to us on this address.
Mail from external addresses is currently blocked.

Access will be granted once permission to access the cohort has been
formally granted and DAP has been informed. You will receive an
automated email that ``Changes to your Identity were processed``, after
which it may take up to 24 hours before you can access the project
folder(s) on Esrum.

.. warning::

   Transfer of data to the new servers has not yet been completed. You
   can still apply for access to cohorts, but you may not be granted
   access until everything is ready.
