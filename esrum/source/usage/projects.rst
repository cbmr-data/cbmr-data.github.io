 Requesting projects and datasets
##################################

This page describes how to request new projects (located in
``/projects``) and datasets (``/datasets``). For a detailed description
of these, see the :ref:`p_usage_filesystem` page.

Briefly,

-  Projects are meant to house apps, data, and results for individual
   projects and the people working on those projects. Every member of a
   project will have write access to the standard subfolder in the
   project folder, and will be able to deposit data.

-  Datasets are meant for static data and as such only the owner has the
   ability to add or modify files in a dataset. This is useful for both
   raw data and for results that are intended to be shared across
   different projects.

.. warning::

   When dealing with GDPR projected data, the project and datasets
   should correspond to the data processing agreement in place for each
   dataset. *Do not* store datasets under different GDPR data processing
   agreement in the same project or dataset. Similarly, do not place
   GDPR protected and non-GDPR protected data in the same
   project/dataset, if different people needs access to the GDPR and
   non-GDPR data. Keeping datasets separate ensures that only people
   with relevant permissions from the data owner are able to access the
   GDPR protected data.

*************************************
 Requesting a new project or dataset
*************************************

To request the creation of a new project or dataset, please `contact us
<p_contact>`_ with the following information.

#. **Who should administer the project/dataset?** This person will be
   responsible controlling access to the project via the `Identity
   Management System`_; we recommend that the person chosen for this
   role is on a long-term contract. A member of DAP will be added as a
   co-admin, so that we can provide support.

   DAP can also take sole responsibility for administration of the
   project/dataset. This is recommended for projects/datasets involving
   data for which access requires permission from one or more
   data-owners. In this case, we need the contact information for the
   data owner(s), so that we can collect these permissions as required.

#. **Who should have access to the project?** Who, other than the owner
   of the project or dataset, should be given access once it has been
   created?

#. **How much data do you expect to store?** UCPH-IT needs a rough
   estimate of how much data you expect to store in project or dataset
   in the first six months: 1 TB or less, 100 TB or less, or more than
   100 TB.

#. **What is the name of the project?** This name will be used for the
   project or dataset folder, and has to be unique across UCPH. It may
   be helpful to include either a center name (*e.g.* ``cbmr_``) or
   group name (*e.g.* ``dap_``) as a prefix. Only letters (``a`` to
   ``z``), digits (``0`` to ``9``), and underscores (``_``) are allowed,
   and it is recommended to pick a reasonably short name. Note that the
   name is visible to everyone with a UCPH account.

#. **Will your project contain sensitive data?** You must let us know if
   you intend to store *any* sensitive data in the project, GDPR
   protected or otherwise. As a rule of thumb, you should say "yes" if
   you work with human data.

You are always welcome to reach out if you are unsure about any of this.
