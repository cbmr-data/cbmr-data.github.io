Welcome to the Esrum high-performance computing (HPC) cluster at The
Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR_).
Esrum is managed by the `Data Analytics Platform`_ (DAP), and is
available to all employees at CBMR and their collaborators.

In addition to the Esrum HPC cluster, the DAP also provides

-  two :ref:`RStudio <p_service_rstudio>` servers
-  access to more than 80 :ref:`human cohorts <p_human_cohorts>`
-  a `project registry`_ for tracking your projects at CBMR
-  `open source tools and pipeline`_

You are also always welcome to :ref:`contact us <p_contact>` if you have
questions or problems relating to the cluster, cohorts, other services
or resources provided by the platform.

We also kindly ask that you acknowledge the use of services and
resources that we provide. See the :ref:`acknowledgements
<s_acknowledgements>` section on the :ref:`p_guidelines` page for more
information.

.. note::

   This documentation assumes some familiarity with using Linux and bash
   (the default command-line). Users who lack this familiarity may
   benefit from taking the `Mastering the terminal with Bash and Unix`_
   course offered by the Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS_) at
   SUND. If you intend to make use of `R <p_tips_r>`_ or the `RStudio
   <p_service_rstudio>`_ servers, then you may also benefit from the
   `From Excel to R`_ and `R for Data Science`_ courses.

*****************
 Getting started
*****************

We hold an intro-workshop for the Esrum cluster a few times a year,
based on interest, so please :ref:`let us know <p_contact>` if you'd
like to attend a workshop. Future workshops will be announced to all
employees at CBMR. Slides from past workshops are made available on the
:ref:`presentations <p_outreach_presentations>` page.

However, this documentation is explicitly written to help you get
started with using Esrum, so you do not need to wait for the intro
workshop to be announced:

#. Please read the :ref:`p_guidelines` for using Esrum before you
   continue.

#. To get access to Esrum and related resources, see the
   :ref:`p_usage_access_applying` page. Once you have been granted
   access, you can connect to the cluster as described in
   :ref:`connecting to the cluster <p_usage_connecting>` page.

#. On Esrum, you'll find your home folder, datasets, projects, and
   network drives laid out as described on the :ref:`p_usage_filesystem`
   page.

#. Users of Esrum have access to a large library of software provided by
   DAP and UCPH-IT. The :ref:`p_usage_modules` page describes how to
   access this software, and how to request software that is not
   currently available.

#. To run software on Esrum, you must make use of the Slurm_ queuing
   system as described in :ref:`p_usage_slurm`.

#. Finally, the :ref:`p_transfers` page describes how to transfer your
   data to and from Esrum, and to and from services like SIF or
   Computerome.
