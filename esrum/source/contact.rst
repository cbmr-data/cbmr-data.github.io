The `Data Analytics Platform`_, formerly known as the Phenomics
Platform, provides support for the Esrum HPC cluster,
:ref:`p_human_cohorts`, the `Project Registry`_, the
:ref:`p_service_rstudio` servers, and related services. Additionally, we
will gladly assist with general bioinformatics issues, including
installing libraries and other software, debugging problems, performance
improvements, data integration, QC, GWAS, NGS, and more.

We have an open-door policy, and you are always welcome to drop by room
07-8-29 (Unit 8E) at the Maersk Tower, if you need help and/or have
questions about any of our services. Our office is located directly
across from the kitchen on the 8th floor.

You can also contact us via email at `SUND-CBMR-Esrum
<mailto:cbmr-esrum@sund.ku.dk>`_. Note that you *must* use a UCPH e-mail
account when writing to us on this address. Mail from external addresses
is currently blocked.

If you are on the `CBMR Slack server`_ then you can find us in the
