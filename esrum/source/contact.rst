The Esrum HPC cluster is supported by the `Data Analytics Platform`_,
formerly known as the Phenomics Platform.

We have an open-door policy, and you are always welcome to drop by room
07-8-29 (Unit 8E) at the Maersk Tower, if you need help and/or have
questions about the cluster. Our office is located directly across from
the kitchen on the 8th floor.

You can also contact us via email at `SUND-CBMR-Esrum
<mailto:cbmr-esrum@sund.ku.dk>`_. Note that you *must* use a UCPH e-mail
account when writing to us on this address. Mail from external addresses
is currently blocked.

If you are on the `CBMR Slack server`_ then you can find us in the
`#data-analytics <https://cbmr.slack.com/archives/C06TF9LGD47>`_
channel.
