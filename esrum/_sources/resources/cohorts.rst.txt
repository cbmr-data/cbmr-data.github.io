 Human cohorts

The Data Analytics Platform maintains a `list of cohorts`_ and an
associated `catalog of cohort variables`_, in order to help you identify
relevant cohorts for your research. In many, but not all cases, DAP also
facilitates access to this data on Esrum.

The `list of cohorts`_ and the `catalog of cohort variables`_ provide
brief descriptions of the cohorts and of the variables associated with
these, respectively, but you are welcome to :ref:`contact us
<p_contact>` if you have any questions regarding these.

.. warning::

   You must be connected to the UCPH VPN to access either of these
   pages. See the :ref:`p_usage_connecting` page for information about
   using the VPN.

*********************
 Applying for access
*********************

In order to get access to a cohort managed by DAP, the data owner must
first grant approval. This step varies between cohorts, as data owners
have different methods of governing access, and may involve a simple
email exchange, a review by committee, or another type of review.

To initiate this process,

#. ensure that your scientific project(s) are registered in the CBMR
   Project Manager, as described on the :ref:`p_usage_access_applying`
   page. You will need the Project IDs when filling out the data access
   form.

#. fill out the `data access form`_ and send it to `SUND-CBMR-Esrum
   <mailto:cbmr-esrum@sund.ku.dk>`_. Note that you *must* use a UCPH
   e-mail account when writing to us on this address: Mail from external
   addresses is currently blocked.

Access will be granted once permission to access the cohort has been
formally approved by the data owners. You will receive an automated
email that ``Changes to your Identity were processed``, after which it
may take up to 24 hours before you can access the data on Esrum.

.. tip::

   It may be necessary to disconnect from, and reconnect to, Esrum for
   the changes to your permissions to take effect, once you have
   received the notification mentioned above.
