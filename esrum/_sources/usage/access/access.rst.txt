 Applying for access
#####################

.. note::

   If you are an external researcher, student, guest, and otherwise
   collaborating with researchers at CBMR, then you should ask for one
   of your collaborators or supervisors at CBMR to apply for access for
   you, as described below.

Access to the Esrum HPC cluster and a number of related services,
projects, and datasets are managed by the Data Analytics Platform. To
get access, please

#. Register descriptions of the scientific projects that you intend to
   work on using Esrum, if you have not already done so. To do so, for
   each of your projects,

   #. Visit the `Project Manager`_ page and click the `Add Project`_
      tab.

   #. Enter the title of your project, the contact person for the
      project (typically yourself), the contact information for the
      PI/group-leader of the project, and a brief description of the
      project.

   #. Click the ``Add Project`` button, below the project description.
      You will be taken to a page that allows you update your newly
      created project, with the first field showing the ID of your new
      project (e.g. ``CBMR-ABCD12``). Write down this ID.

#. If you have already registered your project(s), then you can look up
   the project IDs via the `Search Project`_ tab in the `Project
   Manager`_.

#. (Optional) To access human cohort data managed by Data Analytics,
   please fill out a data access form, as described on the
   :ref:`p_human_cohorts` page.

#. Email us at `SUND-CBMR-Esrum <mailto:cbmr-esrum@sund.ku.dk>`_, and
   include the IDs of your project(s) and, optionally, the data access
   form describing the human cohorts that you wish to access.

   .. warning::

      You *must* use a UCPH e-mail account when writing to us on this
      address. Mail from external addresses is currently blocked.

Do not hesitate to :ref:`contact us <p_contact>`, if you have any
questions regarding the above instructions.

Once you have been granted access to Esrum and/or related resources, you
will receive an automated email stating that ``Changes to your Identity
were processed``. Please refer to the :ref:`p_usage_connecting` page for
further instructions on how to connect to the cluster, once you have
received this email.

.. warning::

   Note that your account may not be ready by the time you receive the
   email described above. In that case, logging in will result in a
   warning that your home folder does not exist. If so, then simply wait
   a few hours before trying again. This process may take up to a day.

********************************************
 Using the identity management system (IDM)
********************************************

Should you need to apply for access to projects or datasets that are
*not* managed by the Data Analytics Platform, or if you need to add a
user to a project that *you* control, then this may require using the
`Identity Management System`_ (IDM).

An official guide to the identity system used is available here_.

Applying for access using the IDM
=================================

If possible, we recommend simply asking the project/dataset owner to add
you to the project or dataset in question, but the following provides a
brief summary of how to apply through the IDM:

#. Log in at identity.ku.dk_.

#. Click on the ``Manage My Access`` or the ``Manage User Access``
   button. Which button you see will depend on whether you own any
   groups yourself.

   #. If you clicked on the ``Manage User Access`` button then you must
      next search for your own UCPH username (e.g. ``abc123``) and then
      click on the check mark to the left your name *once*. Wait for the
      check mark to turn green, click the ``Next`` button, and then
      proceed with the steps described above.

#. Search for and locate the group corresponding to the resource you
   wish to access. Depending on the kind of resource you wish to apply
   for access to, the names will differ somewhat:

   #. A server group will typically start with the prefix ``SRV-`` and
      end with ``-users``, for example ``SRV-esrumhead-users`` for the
      Esrum head node.

   #. A project group will typically start with ``COMP-PRJ-``, for
      example ``COMP-PRJ-cbmr_shared`` for the ``/projects/cbmr_shared``
      project.

   #. A dataset group will typically start with ``COMP-DATASET-`` and
      end with ``-ro``, for example ``COMP-DATASET-cbmr_shared-ro`` for
      the ``/datasets/cbmr_shared`` dataset containing shared resources.

   .. warning::

      In general, you should *not* be applying for access to projects
      with suffixes like ``-Owners``, ``-admin``, or ``-rw`` unless
      explicitly told to do so by the owner(s) of those resources. These
      suffixes indicate administrative groups and your requests will
      therefore be denied if you apply without reason.

#. Click *once* on the check-mark to the left of the name of the group
   in the resulting list. Wait for the check mark to turn green and then
   click the ``Next`` button. If you get a yellow popup with the message
   ``Cannot Add Access Item. The item you are trying to select is
   already assigned``, then you have already been granted access to this
   resource.

   #. If you get a ``Select Role`` popup, asking you to ``Select the
      business role to assign to this permitted role.``, then we
      recommend that you pick a ``STAFF-ORG`` role from the list.

#. Finally, click the ``Submit`` button to submit your request.

#. Wait for your request to be processed.

Adding users to a group using the IDM
=====================================

#. Log in at identity.ku.dk_.

#. Click on the ``Manage User Access`` button. If you instead have a
   ``Manage My Access`` button, then you do not control access to any
   groups and will not able to carry out these steps.

#. Search for the username of the user you want to add to a group, click
   *once* on the check-mark to the left of the name of the user in the
   resulting list. Wait for the check mark to turn green and then click
   the ``Next`` button.

#. Search for and locate the group corresponding to the resource you
   wish to grant access to. See the corresponding step in the previous
   guide, for a brief description of how groups are named.

#. Click *once* on the check-mark to the left of the name of the group
   in the resulting list. Wait for the check mark to turn green and then
   click the ``Next`` button. See above if you get a ``Cannot Add Access
   Item.`` or a ``Select Role`` popup.

#. Finally, click the ``Submit`` button to submit your request.

#. Wait for your request to be processed.
