server:

.. image:: /usage/images/connecting_ssh_timeout.gif
   :class: gif

#. Firstly verify that you are (still) a member of the appropriate group
   as described in :ref:`s_applying_for_access`, as KU-IT may
   automatically revoke your memberships under certain conditions. No
   notifications are sent when that happens!

#. Secondly verify that you are correctly connected to the KU network:

   #. You must either use a wired connection while physically at CBMR.
   #. Or you must connect via the KU VPN.

   It is not possible to connect to using WIFI at CBMR nor is it
   possible to from outside of CBMR without the use of the VPN. See the
   official VPN documentation in Danish_ or English_ for more
   information.

#. If neither using a wired connection nor connecting the the KU VPN
   fixes the problem, you may need to create a support ticket to have KU
   IT permit you to connect to the server.

   #. Login to the KU `IT Serviceportal`_.

   #. Click the ``Create Ticket`` / ``Opret Sag`` button.

   #. Tick/select the ``Research IT`` / ``Forsknings IT`` category in
      the category/filters list on the left side of the screen.

   #. Click the ``Research Applications Counseling and Support`` /
      ``Forskningsapplikationer RÃ¥dgivning og support`` button.

   #. Click the ``REQUEST`` / ``Bestil`` button.

   #. Write something like "SSH connection times out when attempting to
      connect to esrumhead01fl.unicph.domain" in the "Please describe"
      text-box and describe the steps you have taken to try to fix this
      problem: Tried wired connection at CBMR, tried VPN, etc.

   #. Write "esrumhead01fl.unicph.domain" in the System name text-box.

   #. Click the ``Review & submit`` / ``Gennemse & bestil`` button.

   #. Review your ticket and then click the ``Submit`` / ``Bestil``
      button.
