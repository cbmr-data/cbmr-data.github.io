   These tips/warnings are shown in multiple sections, since we link users directly to subsections and cannot expect them to read top-level blurbs.

.. warning::

   Do not copy data out of ``-AUDIT`` folders without the explicit
   permission from the data controller and never store sensitive data in
   a non-``-AUDIT`` folder!

.. warning::

   Transfers running on the head node will be terminated without
   warning, due to the impact on other users of the cluster.

.. tip::

   Running your transfer in a ``tmux`` or ``screen`` session is
   recommended. This allows your transfer to keep running after you log
   off from Esrum. See the :ref:`p_tips_tmux` page for more information.
